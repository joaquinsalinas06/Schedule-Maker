# ðŸ“… Schedule Maker

This project allows users to input their university courses and generate various schedule variants based on the courses they will take.

## Introduction

The University Schedule Generator automates the process of selecting a schedule from a list of courses. Users can enter the details of their university courses, and the application will generate multiple possible schedules, making it easy to choose the most convenient one.

## Features

### Initial Setup

- **Credit Limits**: Users input the minimum and maximum credits allowed by their university.
- **Adaptability**: The system is based on the semester system in Peru but can be adapted for other systems upon request.

### Enter Courses/Shifts

- **Course Details**: Users add courses, specifying details like course name, credits, and weekly class hours.
- **Shift Creation**: Users can create shifts for each course, including details like section, classroom, professor, and schedule.
- **Visual Representation**: Assign colors to courses for easy identification in the schedule.

### Save Options

- **Persistence**: Users can save their course and shift configurations for future use, ensuring they don't have to re-enter data each time.

### Generate Schedules

- **Automatic Generation**: The application generates all possible schedules based on the entered data.
- **Selection**: Users can review and choose the best schedule option from the generated list.
